* the table must have an option of filtering by level, to display only the players that have a certain level.  Please make the filter selection available on the corresponding column header.

* the table should have a free search input, to allow the user to type a search phrase. The table displays only these players that the search phrase is a substring of their name, their id, their level or their score.

* Player names should always be capitalized

* Players that are suspected of cheating need to  have a clear indication in the table - freely choose how to visually create the distinguishing effect of cheaters (colors, fonts etc...) to make it clear the player is a suspect.

* If you find that it serves the purpose of displaying the tournament's results - you may add more information, options and so forth to the page - as you wish.

* In addition to the table, the page should contain the title “Tournament 101 - Final Results”. Place and size it to your best judgment.
